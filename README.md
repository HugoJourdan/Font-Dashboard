GlyphsApp propose two different kind of Color Labels.

* `Glyph Color Label` , assigned to glyphs with Right-Click
* `Layer Color Label` , assigned to layers with Right-Click + Option

A glyph can have only one Glyph Color Label, but many Layer Color Labels (as many as the number of layers of the glyph). A useful use of layer color labels is to set them to indicate the state of a layer. For example, you could decide to use the ![Capture d’écran 2022-06-15 à 20.43.33|32x32, 50%](upload://ePMsUmXa7nwz0qOEOCqHk5jrha4.jpeg) Red layer color for layers that need outline corrected.



This Plugin is a alternative way to use Layer Color Labels. Instead of setting Layer Color Labels with ⌥ + Right-Click,

The plugin requires a **coolorWorkflow.txt** file stored in either ~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/info/ or the same directory as the current Glyphs source file. Preference is given to the latter allowing for the sharing of the **fontdashboard.txt** file with glyphs source files to retain labelling information between project contributors. 

The **coolorWorkflow.txt** file requires the formatting `colorName=meaning`, with each key on a newline and with no space surrounding the '='. An example, with the defined colorNames is given below. 

```
red=Step 1
orange=Step 2
brown=Step 3
yellow=Step 4
lightGreen=Step 5
darkGreen=Step 6
lightBlue=Step7
darkBlue=Step 8
purple=Step 9
magenta=Step 10
lightGray=Step 11
charcoal=Step 12
```

You can customise color order by changing line order, and you can also hide a color by deleting the line associated with it.
Here is an example :

```
red=Step 1
yellow=Step 2
magenta=Step 3
purple=Step 4
lightGreen=Step 5
```
